# OnlineVideoPlayer
This was a try to develop a module for grabbing video frames from RTSP stream.
It needs DirectShow codecs to work, I have used K-lite codec pack.

Features:
  - Play video;
  - Play sound;
  - Grab series of video frames and save them to jpeg files;
  - Seek to some playback position one or more times (if it supports seeking);
  - View current playback position.

Some parts of code were taken from Romix (http://www.x-romix.narod.ru/) and some other were found on http://basicsprog.ucoz.ru/publ/6-1-0-32
