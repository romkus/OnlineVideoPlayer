[KNOWN ISSUES]

The API is targeted at C/C++ programmers. It's available for Delphi programmers but
most string and path functions are akward to use due to the heavy use of pointers.
Furthermore, the documentation on a lot of functions is very poor, sometimes incorrect
and/or incomplete and sometimes even non-existent. Finally, some functions (mostly
the string and path functions) produce access violations if the parameters are incorrect.

Some of the functions/macro's we're not translated using the .par syntax. They are manually
translated and use the IFDEF UNICODE idiom.

SHOpenRegStream defaults to SHOpenRegStream2 in the original header. This is not the
case in the interface unit. If you want SHOpenRegStream2 then explicitly use SHOpenRegStream2!

[DEFINES]

Although the _WIN32_IE_5 conditional is supposed to exclude all functions that require
IE5 if defined, this is really not True. Approximately 15 functions we're added to
ShLwApi in the March 99 release and all of them require IE5 (installed by default
on Windows 2000). See also BugList&Fixes below.

_WIN32_IE_5        If not defined then functions that require IE 5 are not available
_WIN32_IE_501      If not defined then functions that require IE 5.01 are not available

UNICODE		   Some functions/macro's could not be translated using the .par syntax
		   and we're translated "manually". These functions use the UNICODE 
		   conditional directive to set the default for the functions (eg
		   MyFunction = MyFunctionA or MyFunction = MyFunctionW).

The following defines are of no use for Delphi programmers. The linker already removes
all non-referenced functions anyway. The C++ linker does not automatically does so
and hence these defines exist. I only included them for completeness.

NO_SHLWAPI_STRFCNS If defined then string functions are not available
NO_SHLWAPI_PATH    If defined then path functions are not available
NO_SHLWAPI_REG     If defined then registry functions are not available
NO_SHLWAPI_STREAM  If defined then stream functions are not available
NO_SHLWAPI_GDI     If defined then gdi functions are not available
